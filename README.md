# Greyscale-Mask-Estimator
I've crafted a MobileNetV2 model for robust mask detection. Trained on a dataset of 20,000 grayscale images, each 224x224 pixels, the model excels at discerning whether individuals are wearing masks. This adaptation demonstrates the versatility of deep learning, showcasing its ability to address urgent real-world needs with efficiency and precision.
